# Autonomous Ground Vehicle
Navigation system for an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) that detects and avoids obstacles.

## Description
Simplied version of an obstacle detection and avoidance system for an autonomous ground vehicle. The vehicle navigates towards a goal while avoiding obstacles.

The system uses data from a Lidar to detect and avoid obstacles.
The vehicle will navigate using a set of points as input. It will move from point to point while avoiding obstacles.

## Environment

All development and simulation was done using Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL)
- Ubuntu distro: 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy)
- ROS2 distro: Humble
- Gazebo distro: Fortress LTS

## Disclamer

This article assumes having basic knowledge of ROS, Gazebo, LiDARs, and Linux, since these will not be covered here.
